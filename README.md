# Collection Boxes
This is a temporary fork of https://github.com/nstory/collection_boxes to focus on data analysis in Python using pandas, geopandas and Jupyter notebooks. The goal is the same, to track the additional and removal of USPS collections boxes to better understand what is going on in the United States. 

All data updates, planning, FOIA requests...etc will be done out of that repo, so please visit that repo, contribute, and share on social media.
